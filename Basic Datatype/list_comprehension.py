"""
You are given three integers x ,y and z representing the dimensions of a cuboid along with an integer n.
Print a list of all possible coordinates given by (i,j,k)  on a 3D grid where the sum of i+j+k is not equal to n
Use list comprehensions rather than multiple loops, as a learning exercise.


Solution

take x,y,z as input
by permutation combination make possible coordinate combinations
check if sum of coordinates is equal to n or not and if not add them in a list
